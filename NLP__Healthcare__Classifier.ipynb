       "array(['I don\\'t disagree with you in principle. I\\'m just saying that Entresto has been a major failure of Novartis commercial organisation. They (Novartis) were totally exposed at Q1 call. With reimbursement issues being resolved, the true underlying problem with Entresto was unveiled: Novartis failed to create the demand for the drug. Their disease-awareness campaign in the US (the drowning man) was incredibly poor (fear- and panic-inducing). What is more, they advertised the wrong condition. They were raising awareness of life-threatening ACUTE heart failure instead of CHRONIC heart failure, for which Entresto is indicated. Entresto has nothing to do with the treatment of acute heart failure. If that was not due to their shocking lack of knowledge of the disease area, it can only be explained as a conscious misleading of patients. They managed to alienate medical community, advocacy groups and top KOLs, including their own principal investigator in Entresto trials who publicly expressed his concerns. It?s unheard of. But it provides clues as to what actually happened. An incompetent strategic marketing team establishes the wrong go-to-market model based on wrong market assumptions. And they persistently kept going in the wrong direction, completely oblivious to the extent of their own incompetence. It\\'s a typical example of ignorance bias (\"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge?). If it wasn?t for the analysts who were challenging Novartis in public, who knows how long they would have continued to be in denial. It is stunning that Novartis, once a leading cardiovascular company, bombed the launch of a cardiovascular primary care product - a combo of their own Diovan. With this, they discovered a new low. David was let down by his own people. He trusted them, but he should have known better. His hands-off management style didn?t work at Novartis Pharma (in contrast to Oncology). It?s a toxic culture, populated with yes people, where competences and skills are not valued or required for promotion. It is strange though that after so many years in operational positions, Joerg seemingly stayed uninvolved. At least that\\'s how it looks from the outside.',\n",

       "       \"Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic(NEW YORK) -- Queen Latifah is taking matters to heart, literally. The Emmy and Grammy winner has joined forces with the American Heart Association for its Red Steps campaign. The idea is for people to post photos of themselves taking steps while wearing red socks, to become more physically active and raise awareness of the risks and symptoms of heart failure. The goal is six million ?red steps,? in recognition of the nearly six million Americans living with heart failure For Latifah, born Dana Owens, the effort is personal. Her mother, Rita Owens, suffers from scleroderma, an incurable autoimmune disease that has caused scar tissue build up in her lungs. The 66-year-old former schoolteacher also has pulmonary hypertension, which impacts her ability to breathe. ?It's just a way for us to show support for all of those people who are dealing with the condition and those who care for them,? Latifah told ABC Radio. Latifah said her mother?s approval of the campaign was imperative to her getting involved. ?I really wanted her to be involved and I wanted her permission,? Latifah confided. ?She's just so eloquent and positive in the way she puts things, it's something that we as a family like to share with other people because realize that by her talking about some of her medical issues, a lot of people are reaching out and saying 'Me too.'? The rapper turned actress says the campaign has also helped her get healthy. ?I am not perfect when it comes to just staying fit constantly all the time,? she shared, saying the campaign reminds her to be diligent and that she doesn?t have to do it alone. But most of all it?s about helping other. ?Sometimes I can rally that support and I can do right in my own group of family and friends,? she says. Copyright ? 2016, ABC Radio.

       "'I don\\'t disagree with you in principle. I\\'m just saying that Entresto has been a major failure of Novartis commercial organisation. They (Novartis) were totally exposed at Q1 call. With reimbursement issues being resolved, the true underlying problem with Entresto was unveiled: Novartis failed to create the demand for the drug. Their disease-awareness campaign in the US (the drowning man) was incredibly poor (fear- and panic-inducing). What is more, they advertised the wrong condition. They were raising awareness of life-threatening ACUTE heart failure instead of CHRONIC heart failure, for which Entresto is indicated. Entresto has nothing to do with the treatment of acute heart failure. If that was not due to their shocking lack of knowledge of the disease area, it can only be explained as a conscious misleading of patients. They managed to alienate medical community, advocacy groups and top KOLs, including their own principal investigator in Entresto trials who publicly expressed his concerns. It?s unheard of. But it provides clues as to what actually happened. An incompetent strategic marketing team establishes the wrong go-to-market model based on wrong market assumptions. And they persistently kept going in the wrong direction, completely oblivious to the extent of their own incompetence. It\\'s a typical example of ignorance bias (\"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge?). If it wasn?t for the analysts who were challenging Novartis in public, who knows how long they would have continued to be in denial. It is stunning that Novartis, once a leading cardiovascular company, bombed the launch of a cardiovascular primary care product - a combo of their own Diovan. With this, they discovered a new low. David was let down by his own people. He trusted them, but he should have known better. His hands-off management style didn?t work at Novartis Pharma (in contrast to Oncology). It?s a toxic culture, populated with yes people, where competences and skills are not valued or required for promotion. It is strange though that after so many years in operational positions, Joerg seemingly stayed uninvolved. At least that\\'s how it looks from the outside.'"
